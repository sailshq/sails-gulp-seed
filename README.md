# sails-gulp-seed

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.com) 1.0 application utilizing the Gulp 4 task runner.

This app is the result of running `sails new --without grunt` and then adding some files, dependencies and configuration to facilitate a basic Gulp asset pipeline.

See the [gulp-3](https://github.com/sailshq/sails-gulp-seed/tree/gulp-3) branch for a seed using Gulp 3.

> This is just an example of how you can set up your Sails app to work with Gulp.  Refer to the [Gulp documentation](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/4.0/docs/API.md) for a full guide to Gulp usage and configuration!
